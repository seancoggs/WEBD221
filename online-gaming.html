        <h2>Connecting with Friends</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best aspects of gaming is connecting with friends. At one point, this meant gathering in the same room to play on the same console or organizing a “LAN party” to connect multiple computers over a Local Area Network. As gaming technology advanced, these in-person gatherings transitioned to online platforms, making it easier than ever to connect with friends and compete with players worldwide.

        <h2>Xbox Live Emerges</h2>
        <p>
            In 2002, Microsoft launched Xbox Live. This subscription-based service let players enjoy multiplayer games online, voice chat with friends, and access an online store. It revolutionized the gaming world and created a global community of players. Shortly after, PlayStation introduced its own service, known as PSN (PlayStation Network).

        <h2>PSN vs Xbox: A Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>
            PSN vs Xbox was important to me because when I first wanted to get my own console that was not outdated, I had to talk my parents into getting one. At the time, PSN was free while Xbox Live required a monthly subscription. I knew I could convince my parents to get me a console for Christmas, but there was no chance they would agree to ongoing fees for Xbox Live. So, I asked for a PlayStation. The one they got me came with “The Last of Us,” which is still my favorite game ever played, so I’m very happy with how it worked out.

        <h2>PlayStation Plus</h2>
        <p>
            As gaming evolved, platforms began adding even more value to their services. In 2010, PlayStation introduced PlayStation Plus, a subscription service that took PSN to the next level by offering free monthly games, exclusive discounts, and features like cloud saves. This added extra incentive for players to invest in the PlayStation ecosystem, giving them access to more than just multiplayer capabilities.

        <h2>Xbox Game Pass</h2>
        <p>
            In 2017, Microsoft shook up the industry again with Xbox Game Pass, introducing a new way to play games. Instead of buying individual titles, players could pay a monthly fee and access a massive library of games. This model changed how gamers approached ownership and accessibility.

        <h2>Steam's Dominance on PC</h2>
        <p>
            While console services transformed how we accessed games, Steam had been quietly dominating the PC gaming world since 2003. It provided indie developers with a platform to reach global audiences and gave players a centralized hub for buying, managing, and modding their games. Frequent sales and community features cemented its place in gaming culture.

        <h2>NVIDIA’s Impact</h2>
        <p>
            At the same time, NVIDIA was pushing the boundaries of gaming technology with GPUs that delivered cutting-edge graphics. Their GeForce NOW service took things even further, allowing players to stream high-quality games without needing expensive hardware, opening up gaming to a broader audience.

        <h2>A World Without Barriers</h2>
        <p>
            These innovations have not only made gaming more inclusive but also more dynamic. Whether it's a subscription service offering access to hundreds of games or a cloud platform eliminating hardware barriers, gaming has become a truly global, connected experience. It’s incredible to see how far we’ve come from those LAN parties to a world where you can play with anyone, anywhere, at any time.
