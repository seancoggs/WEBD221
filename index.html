        <h2>The Beginning of Video Games</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>1950s Origins</h3>
            <p>Video Games trace all the way back to the 1950s. One of the first games to be recognized was “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two" target="_blank">Tennis for Two</a>” created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Higinbotham" target="_blank">William Higinbotham</a> in 1958. It was put on display in the Brookhaven National Laboratory, showcasing the potential of technology in the entertainment industry.</p>

            <h3>1970s to Early 1980s</h3>
            <p>For me, when I hear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man" target="_blank">Pac-Man</a> I think of <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man" target="_blank">Google Pac-Man</a> which made its debut in 2010, it was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcin_Wichary" target="_blank">Marcin Wichary</a> to celebrate Pac-Man's 30th anniversary. The original came out in 1980 and became the first video game character to become globally recognized. The game was created by Namco and its success showed that video games could become mainstream and have cultural and economic influence.</p>

        <h2>The Golden Age of Gaming</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Arcade Boom</h3>
            <p>The late 70s and early 80s marked what is now known as the Golden Age of Gaming. Games like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a>” in 1978 and other classics like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga" target="_blank">Galaga</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)" target="_blank">Donkey Kong</a>” created huge cultural phenomena. In 1983 the gaming industry crashed which marked the end of the Golden age. This was largely due to a saturated console market, personal computer competition, and competition with third-party publishing rights.</p>

            <h3>Nintendo</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a> came out in 1985 and helped the industry come back after the crash in 1983. The NES brought new quality games like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros." target="_blank">Super Mario Bros</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda</a>” which attracted a large audience back to the gaming industry.</p>
            
            <p>Arcades became social hubs for friends to meet up and compete with one another in their favorite games. And home consoles like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600" target="_blank">Atari 2600</a> brought your favorite games into your own home.</p>

        <h2>The Future of Gaming</h2>
            <p>The future of gaming has great potential. As new technologies are being introduced like Virtual Reality (VR), 3D experiences, and cloud gaming being available over streams, it seems limitless what games can be explored.</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/media/2024/10/vrheadsets-2048px-08429-2x1-1.jpg?width=1024&quality=75&crop=2:1&auto=webp" alt="VR headset" width="500">

            <p>There are concerns over some cloud gaming as the game ownership can be taken away from the player. If a provider no longer hosts a game, you won’t be able to play it. This can come with both good and bad; it's less expensive to rent a game, but you never really own it. VR has not really reached its full potential, but as new technologies continue to emerge, it could expand rapidly before we know it.</p>
